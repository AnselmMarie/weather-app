# INSIGHT2PROFIT Server

## Requirements

1. The project has been locked to use npm only.
2. Make sure you have at least node 14.8.0. This version allows async/await at the top level - https://pprathameshmore.medium.com/top-level-await-support-in-node-js-v14-3-0-8af4f4a4d478
3. (optional) Update your IDE to format your code in prettier. Change your settings to format your code on save.

## Installation

1. Install node modules
2. Run the npm command below (runs on port 3000)

```bash
npm run start
```

## Other

The project uses a feature-based folder structure which allows scalability in the code. Since the position is a Front End Architect, I focused more on the client side. The server code still received some patterns and standards.
Normally I would create additional md files to document all the patterns and standards.
